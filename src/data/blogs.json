    "text": "Deer hunting is a whirlpool of beliefs, theories, facts and fallacies. Some ideas are right. Some are wrong. And others fall somewhere in-between. Now, I’m not saying your granddaddy ain’t a good deer hunter. Chances are he’s killed more deer with his open-sighted, lever-action Marlin 30-30 than all the local youngins hollerin’ “Smoked him,” “Pole-waxed that joker,” or my personal (least) favorite, “Just gave that ol’ slob a dirt nap” combined. But our past (and current) generations of deer hunters are somewhat responsible for a number of myths that deer hunters still believe today. All joking aside, I’m sure your granddaddy is/was a great deer hunter. So was your daddy. And so are you.That said, there’s quite a few fallacies that have floated around the deer hunting wavelengths for far too long. And it’s high-time we snuff out the false flames.",

    "text": "<p>Amid the farm houses and barns dotting the Mad River Valley area of rural Vermont, five miles north of Sugarbush ski resort, Marisa Mauro is making butter.</p><p>About 700 pounds of it every week.</p><p>While she and her assistant pack up golden bricks of butter, they can stare out at panoramic views of lush green hills that go technicolor red and yellow in autumn and sparkly white in winter.</p><p>But there's no daydreaming here. Her business, Ploughgate Creamery at Bragg Farm, is booming, and her butter sells for $16 to $20 per pound to specialty shops, co-ops and Whole Foods grocery stores around the country.</p><p><q>I'd say the biggest difference with our butter is that it's handmade, and our hands are on every step of the process,</q> said Mauro, 33. <q>Two girls are cranking out a lot of butter.</q></p><p>Mauro's butter is rich and fatty, fresh but nutty, and it has a grassy tang that comes straight from the cows who made the cream. Those cows live just 30 miles down the road at Monument Farms. (Visit them to get fresh coffee milk, a New England original that adds sweet coffee flavor to cold milk.)</p><p>Mauro packs some of the butter without salt and mixes large sea salt crystals into the rest, selling it as a salted variety with little flakes of texture and even more flavor.</p>",
